# DYNAMIC PROGRAMING (DP)

It is powerful technique used to solve optimization problems by breaking them into simpler overlapping subproblems

## PRIMARY APPROACHES.

There are 2 primary approaches for dp.

1. ### TOP-DOWN (MEMOIZATION)

* Uses recursion with memoization to store results of subproblems.
* Focuses on breaking the problem recursively until the base cases are reached.
* Example: Solving Fibonacci sequence recursively with memoization.

2. ### BOTTOM-UP (TABULATION)

* Uses an iterative process to build solutions from the smallest subproblems up to the original problem.
* Focuses on filling a table (array) to solve subproblems iteratively.
* Example: Solving Fibonacci sequence iteratively with an array.
